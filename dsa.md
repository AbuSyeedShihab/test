**Experiment No: 1**

**Experiment Name: Introduction to Markdown Syntax**

**Theory:**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text documents. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which is then converted into HTML or other formats. Markdown is commonly used for creating documentation, readme files, and online posts.


**Code (with Output) - C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, Markdown!";
    return 0;
}
